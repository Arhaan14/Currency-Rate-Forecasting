# Currency-Rate-Forecasting
This project aims to predict future currency exchange rates using historical financial data and machine learning techniques. By leveraging time series analysis, this system forecasts exchange rates, providing valuable insights for traders, investors, and businesses involved in international transactions.

## Features
- **Historical Data Analysis**: The system uses historical exchange rate data to identify trends and patterns.
- **Forecasting**: Utilizes machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, ARIMA) to predict future exchange rates.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualizes historical trends and forecasted data for easy interpretation.
- **Accuracy Evaluation**: Evaluates the model's performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Statsmodels
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
